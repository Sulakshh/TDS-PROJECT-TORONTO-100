-Retrieval/scrapping of data from api :- I used python module **requests** to retrieve the data from GITHUB_API for users.csv and repositories.csv,also incorporated the use of **csv** module to write the fetched data into csv file.

-Interesting fact:- Surprisingly many developers who belong from toronto dont work in a company, fostering the **freelance** and **gig** economy culture.

-developer recommendation:- For recognition and visibility the developers should actively maintain their repositories and connect with each other(both company and freelance) to increase the followers and reach.
